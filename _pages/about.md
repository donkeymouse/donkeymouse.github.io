I'm a Ph.D. Candidate under the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Seoul National University, advised by [Prof. Ayoung Kim](https://ayoungk.github.io/). My main area of research revolves around robotics applications for thermal infrared imaging that spans across deep learning-based computer vision applications (object detection, segmentation, optical flow estimation, GAN-based image translations) and SLAM. Alongside my main research, I am also currently working on underwater image enhancement using deep generative models. 

Prior to my Ph.D. program, I completed my Masters in [Robotics Program](https://robots.kaist.ac.kr/),[KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/), under the supervision of [Prof. Dong-Soo Kwon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zDaw7hkAAAAJ&hl=ko). During my Masters, I also took a keen interest in human robot interaction and facial expression recognition. As a result, I consider cognitive robotics and HRI as a subfield of interest. 

For more information about me, please see my full [CV](/cv/) or please reach out to me via email.
